                    <p>The day has finally come. Today is the first day of Cohort 26. Today we had introductions and a few hundred motivational slides. I feel fear and excitment for what will come. The one thing that I realize today is you can never do enough
                        pre-work. Things will be moving fast for sure. That's ok, I have a strategy. That is to remain calm and stay the course. I know this is going to be extremely tough but, the reward will be great. Coding to me is a combination of
                        logic and creativity. The main driving force for me to learn coding is to create solutions to problems and or create an application that is useful and scalable. I can't wait to see what tomorrow brings.</p>

                    <p> Today we reviewed what we went over yesterday with Github. I am pretty comfortable with the basics. I know that there is a lot more to cover and it's very complex. That was confirmed when we had presentations today from Cohort 25.
                        Each group had about 5 students all working together at all levels of expereince. Each group shared how there was a complexity at understanding Git and GitHub. Which is key when you are working with a team.

                    </p>
                    <p>Today the challange for me was working with JavaScript on the DOM. All though I can look at JavaScript and read along and understand how things work, when I am challanged to write functions I sometimes draw a blank. Tonight I am certainly
                        going over funcions in JavaScript again. As difficult as things are to learn and grasp, It does not make me want to quit or give up. Then again it's only day two. One of the other students today said he openly wept when he was
                        in the restroom "mid-Stream " after two weeks. There is no misconception that this is a challanging career choice. I know it will never end. Sure, I will get to the point where I am understanding more, but tomorow will bring new
                        technology and new code to learn. To choose this career is to choose a life of learning... Or, insanity! Ready for day 3!</p>

                        Today we tackled JavaScript and functions head on! It was great and at the same time a very tough day. We worked with Loops, array's and the exercies were great. I am getting used to working with Git as I code as well. I am trying to develop great habits.
                        Tonight I spent time working on the exercises I didn't complete today. My goal is to learn every day. Regardless how difficult the challanges may be. I will learn every day.

                        Today was a great day! Yesterday not so much. Yesterday was pretty tough with a JavaScript exercise we had about JavaScript Objects. The one thing I am discovering is all though I can read code and understand what I am looking at, it's a differnt story
                        when you actually are sitting down and writing from scratch. That is going to sink in after repetiton of hands on coding. As our fearless leader John said, "You can learn about and read about coding all you want, you won't learn
                        it unless your coding". This is true.
                        <br> Today we worked on a group project. We had requirments for a simple HTML site with CSS. My group was the best. It was a great combination of skill levels. We all helped each other. I felt great about what I contributed and
                        my group did as well. We are really focused on using GIT and GIT Hub for our project. This has been a great way to learn. Our project is posted on GIT HUB with the link below. All and all a great day. I need to keep up on my JavaScript
                        exercises and practices. I am very happy about my decision to come to this school. I know I'll have good and tough days but no day will be bad. I plan on also updating this blog to fancy it up as time goes on as well. I plan to
                        keep this blog going for sure. That's all for now. Our Project: https://github.com/nss-day-cohort-26/intelligence-report-ardent-antelopes
